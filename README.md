# Road-Accident-Analysis
In 2020, more than 300 people lost their lives on the roads in Quebec, more than 1,000 were seriously injured and 3,000 slightly injured[1]. Although these figures are down compared to 2019, more resources could be implemented to reduce them by increasing the authorities’ intervention capacity.<br>The objective of this study is therefore to predict the severity of a road accident based on the situation in which it occurred. By providing the authorities with the circumstances of an accident, they could instantly assess the severity and send the intervention units most suited to the situation. I am using a supervised learning framework where I will use classification methods such as **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests.**
